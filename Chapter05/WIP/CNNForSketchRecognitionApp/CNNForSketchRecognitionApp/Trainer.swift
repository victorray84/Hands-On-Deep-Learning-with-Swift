         ### Training in batches
         One of the hyperparameters you'll adjust when training a neural network is the batch size i.e.
         how much data you expose your network to a during each *step*. It, the batch size, offers practical and
         tuning capabilities. Sometimes it's not feasible to fit all your data into memory therefore its necessary
         to work in smaller batches, the other is that your network's loss function may be susceptible by the
         size due to adjusting to the mean, working in smaller batches provides some way of fine tuning that would
         be otherwise missed when working on the larger sample.
         
         Our dataloader will return a predefined batch and continue returning a batch until no data is available;
         afterwards we would reset it and start from the begining - below is an extract demonstrating this.
